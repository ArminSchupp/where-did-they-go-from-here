Show "Readers who viewed this page, also viewed" a.k.a. followed posts on your page. Much like Amazon.com's product pages.

== Description ==

Have you seen Amazon.com's product pages? Amazon is a great example of visitor retention through recommendations. All of Amazon's pages have a "Customers who viewed this also viewed". And how many times have you clicked those links? I know I have!

Now you can implement the same feature on your WordPress blog. **WebberZone Followed Posts** let's you show "Readers who viewed this page, also viewed" links on your page.

The plugin tracks the pages, posts and custom post types that visitors click through from the current post. You can then display these followed posts automatically at the bottom of your posts, using a shortcode or via the inbuilt widget.

__If you're looking for a plugin that displays posts related to the content, look no further than [Contextual Related Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contextual-related-posts/).__

= Key features =
* **Automatic**: The plugin will start displaying visited posts on your site and feed automatically after the content when you activate the plugin
* **Shortcode**: Use `[wherego]` to display the followed posts
* **Widget**: Find the __Followed posts__ widget to display the posts in your theme's sidebar
* **Manual install**: Want more control over placement? Check the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/where-did-they-go-from-here/#faq) on which functions are available for manual install
* **Exclusions**: Exclude select posts and pages from the list of posts. Exclude posts from select categories from the list of posts
* **Supports all post types**: The visited posts list lets you include posts, pages, attachments or any other custom post type!
* **Styles**: The output is wrapped in CSS classes which allows you to easily style the list. You can enter your custom CSS styles from within WordPress Admin area
* **Customizable and extendable**: Extendable via filters and actions. Style with CSS or use the inbuilt plugin API
* **Thumbnail support**: Display thumbnails as well as text. The plugin tries multiple methods to fetch a thumbnail or you can even specify a default one

= How can I customise the output? =

Check out the settings page for a wide array of settings that let you customise the plugin output. You can also style the followed posts list using CSS. The following are the main classes that can be styled:

* **wherego_related**: CSS Class on all pages

* **wherego_thumb**: Class that is used for the thumbnail / post image

* **wherego_title**: Class that is used for the title / text

* **wherego_excerpt**: Class of the `span` tag for excerpt (if included)

You can add the CSS code in the **Custom Styles** section of the plugin settings page or in your theme's *style.css* file. To find out the detailed list of available styles, check out the HTML output of the generated code.


= Shortcode =

Use `[wherego]` to display the followed posts

= Manual install =

**echo_wherego()**

Use `<?php if ( function_exists( 'echo_wherego' ) ) {
	echo_wherego(); } ?>` to display the followed posts.
You can also use this function to display posts on any type of page generated by WordPress including homepage and archive pages.

This function takes an array of options similar to the shortcode above.
