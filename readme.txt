Show "Readers who viewed this page, also viewed" links on your page. Much like Amazon.com's product pages.

== Description ==

Have you seen Amazon.com's product pages? Amazon is a great example of visitor rentention through recommendations. All of Amazon's pages have a "Customers who viewed this also viewed". And how many times have you clicked those links?

Would you like to implement the same feature on your WordPress blog?

<a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/where-did-they-go-from-here/">Where did you go from here</a> is a feature rich WordPress plugin that will show "Readers who viewed this page, also viewed" links on your page.

The plugin will track what pages or posts visitors on your sites click through and will display this list for the corresponding post. What better way to retain users than to show them exactly what real people are visiting.

= How can I customise the output? =

All options can be customized within the Options page in WP-Admin itself

You can customise the CSS output. This plugin uses the following CSS classes / IDs:

* **wherego_related**: ID of the the `div` that surrounds the list items on single posts, pages and attachments.

* **wherego_related**: CSS Class on all pages

* **wherego_thumb**: Class that is used for the thumbnail / post image

* **wherego_title**: Class that is used for the title / text

* **wherego_excerpt**: Class of the `span` tag for excerpt (if included)

You can add code to your *style.css* file of your theme to style the related posts list or in the **Custom Styles** tab.

= How does the plugin select thumbnails? =

The plugin selects thumbnails in the following order:

1. Post Thumbnail image: The image that you can set while editing your post in WordPress &raquo; New Post screen

2. Post meta field: This is the meta field value you can use when editing your post. The default is `post-image`

3. First image in the post: The plugin will try to fetch the first image in the post

3. Video Thumbnails: Meta field set by <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/video-thumbnails/">Video Thumbnails</a>

4. Default Thumbnail: If enabled, it will use the default thumbnail that you specify in the Settings screen

The plugin uses <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/">timthumb</a> to generate thumbnails by default. Depending on the configuration of your webhost you might run into certain problems. Please check out <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2010/11/timthumb-hints-tips/">the timthumb troubleshooting page</a> regarding permission settings for the folder and files.

= Manual install =

The following functions are available in case you wish to do a manual install of the posts by editing the theme files.

**echo_ald_wherego()**

If you disable automatic display of visited posts please add `<?php if ( function_exists( 'echo_ald_wherego' ) ) { echo_ald_wherego(); } ?>` to your template file where you want the posts to be displayed.
You can also use this function to display posts on any type of page generated by WordPress including homepage and archive pages.
