Show "Readers who viewed this page, also viewed" a.k.a. followed posts on your page. Much like Amazon's product pages.

## Description

Have you seen Amazon's product pages? Amazon is a great example of visitor retention through recommendations. All of Amazon's pages have a "Customers who bought this item also bought". And how many times have you clicked those links? I know I have!

Now you can implement the same feature on your WordPress blog. **Where did you go from here** let's you show "Readers who viewed this page, also viewed" links on your page.

The plugin tracks the pages, posts and custom post types that visitors click through from the current post. You can then display these followed posts automatically at the bottom of your posts, using a shortcode or in your sidebar using the inbuilt widget.

__If you're looking for a plugin that displays posts related to the content, look no further than [Contextual Related Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contextual-related-posts/)__

### Key features

* **Automatic**: The plugin will start displaying visited posts on your site and feed automatically after the content when you activate the plugin

* **Styles**: The output is wrapped in CSS classes which allows you to easily style the list. You can enter your custom CSS styles from within WordPress Admin area
