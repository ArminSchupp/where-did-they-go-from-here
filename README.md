Show "Readers who viewed this page, also viewed" links on your page. Much like Amazon.com's product pages.

## Description

Have you seen Amazon.com's product pages? Amazon is a great example of visitor retention through recommendations. All of Amazon's pages have a "Customers who viewed this also viewed". And how many times have you clicked those links? I know I have!

Now you can implement the same feature on your WordPress blog.

<a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/where-did-they-go-from-here/">Where did you go from here</a> is a feature rich WordPress plugin that will show "Readers who viewed this page, also viewed" links on your page.

The plugin tracks the pages, posts and custom post types that visitors click through from the current post. You can then display these at the bottom of your post. What better way to retain users than to show them exactly what real people are visiting!
